- Pressing escape when editing kills the program hard
	- Dont have any clue why or how to fix
	- Made a try catch block so it at least exits the program instead of standing on the exeption
- Exiting the program when editing a row makes a check that is not needed
	- A simple flag didnt solve the problem
	- Overriding the close function still causes the message to show
	- No clue how to fix
